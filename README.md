This repository contains the design and simulation files for an adjustable PWM signal motor controller developed as a solution for the En-Core 1.0 Analog Hardware Hackathon organized by the DJS IETE-ISF Student Chapter at SVKM's Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering. The project focuses on generating a variable PWM signal of 500Hz with a variable duty cycle of 20% - 90% and  using  it to control a motor.
Contents
LTspice Simulations: Simulation files demonstrate the circuit's behavior.
Schematics: Circuit diagrams created in KiCad.
PCB Design: KiCad files for the printed circuit board layout.
Gerber files: To print the PCB.
Prerequisites
LTspice: To run the simulation files.
KiCad: To view and modify the schematic and PCB design files.
Open the LTspice simulation files to analyze the circuit's performance.
Use KiCad to explore the schematic and PCB design.
Usage
Simulations: Load the LTspice files to simulate different scenarios and observe the PWM output.
Schematics: Review the design to understand the circuit configuration and op-amp usage.
PCB: Modify and print the PCB design as needed for hardware implementation.
